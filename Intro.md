## Introduction

In our project, we aim to investigate crime patterns in Washington, DC, utilizing data from the Open Data DC portal. The dataset, "Crime Incidents in 2023," comprises 34,215 observations detailing reported crimes, including information on the type of offense, time of occurrence, geographic location, and methods involved.

As individuals, especially students, consider buying a house, renting an apartment, relocating, or traveling, one of the first questions that arises is, "Is it safe?" This concern for safety drives many to seek out neighborhoods with low crime rates before evaluating other factors such as price, amenities, and accessibility. Therefore, understanding crime dynamics is crucial not only for law enforcement but also for residents and potential newcomers to the area.

The primary focus of our analysis is to explore crime density across different areas of Washington, DC, identifying neighborhoods that experience the highest levels of criminal activity. This exploration aims to uncover patterns that can inform law enforcement resource allocation and guide community safety initiatives aimed at crime prevention. By providing insights into crime trends, we hope to empower individuals and families to make informed decisions regarding their living environments.
